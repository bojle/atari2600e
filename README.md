# Atari 2600 Emulator

This is a project that I worked on while in Pre-final Year of my college. 
Submitted as a "Mini Project," I had to write a sufficiently complete emulator 
in under 3 Months time. 

More information about the program can be found in the [Project
Report](docs/final_report.pdf).
