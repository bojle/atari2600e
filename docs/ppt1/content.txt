1. INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atari is (or was) a pioneer in video-game consoles and home computers.
The products of which laid the foundations to the video-game industry
that we see today. One of these products, released in 1977 was the atari
2600. This was one of the first systems to implement microprocessor based consoles 
with swappable-ROMS.

Wikipedia says, "an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer
system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the
guest)." This succintly captures the spirit of an emulator. 

In our case, we are building a software emulator of a harware console.

THE ATARI 2600 SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[a26 refers to atari 2600]

* a26 uses a MOS 6507 CPU (a dumbed down version of the infamous 6502).
* RAM: 128 bytes.
* ROM: Cartride based.
and other peripherals.
* Color pallette: 128-color. 

2. WHY WE CHOSE TO WRITE AN EMULATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Curiosity and desire to understand computers at a deeper level. An 
emulator is at the goldilock's zone of computer programs. Lower than this and
we are dealing with hardwares; any higher and the program becomes an
"application," an abstraction.

WHY THE a26
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplicity and Primacy. The a26 pioneered many techniques in its years. It was
the first to do [TODO: insert many things]. Its demise today has added a
mystical element of the system. Although we were born 30 years too late to 
experience it first-hand, it does not fail to evoke the feelings of nostalgia.

4. Objective/Extent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Getting as close as possible to a Fully complaint emulator capable of 
running a game written for the original system.

The three most crucial parts of the a26 are:
- TIA custom chip
- RIOT 6532 chip
- CPU 6507
